## Contributing Process

### 1. Create an Issue

Before starting work, please create an issue or comment on an existing one to discuss:
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Improvements

### 2. Fork and Branch

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name develop
   ```

### 3. Make Changes

- Write code following our [coding standards](#coding-standards)
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure all tests pass

### 4. Commit Guidelines

We follow conventional commits format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding missing tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(commands): add new /stats command
fix(webhook): handle timeout errors properly
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### 5. Submit Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork
2. Create a pull request against `develop` branch
3. Fill out the PR template completely
4. Link related issues

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code patterns
- Use proper type definitions
- Avoid `any` types when possible

### Code Style

- Use Prettier for formatting
- Follow ESLint rules
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write self-documenting code

### File Structure

```

â”œâ”€â”€ config/          # Configuration files
â”œâ”€â”€ handlers/        # Bot command handlers
â”œâ”€â”€ types/          # TypeScript type definitions
â””â”€â”€ utils/          # Utility functions

â”œâ”€â”€ handlers/       # Request handlers
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/         # Shared utilities
â””â”€â”€ webhook.ts     # Main webhook endpoint
```

### Environment Variables

- Never commit real API keys or secrets
- Use `.env.example` to document required variables
- Use descriptive variable names with proper prefixes

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for new functions
- Use integration tests for API endpoints
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for >80% code coverage

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('FeatureName', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup
  });

  it('should handle normal case', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should handle edge case', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```
